Prim's MST Algorithm

Using the sp0pq-big.txt as input to the program,we get 9999 as the weight of the MST

There was a huge difference in the running times of Binary heap and Indexed heap.

For Binary Heap the running time(sp0-big.txt) was 3452ms
For Indexed Heap the running time(sp0-big.txt) was 435ms

Thus the indexed heap version almost 12.6 faster than binary heap version


To run the Binaryheap project
1. javac *.java
2. java BinaryHeap

To run the Indexedheap project
1. javac *.java
2. java IndexedHeap

To run the MST project
0. Set the path to the input file in MST.java
1. javac *.java
2. java MST
