Comparison for permute() between Take 2 and Heap's algorithm for n = 8..14

n=8
Time taken by take 2 : 24 msec
Time taken by Heap's : 12 msec

n=10
Time taken by take 2 : 73 msec
Time taken by Heap's : 66 msec

n=12
Time taken by take 2 : 9487 msec
Time taken by Heap's : 6425 msec

n=13
Time taken by take 2 : 119486 msec
Time taken by Heap's : 66447 msec

The trend seems to confirm that for n = 14
take 2 will have time approx 20 mins
Heap's will have time approx 7 mins

Tha gap seems to widen as the value of n progresses
