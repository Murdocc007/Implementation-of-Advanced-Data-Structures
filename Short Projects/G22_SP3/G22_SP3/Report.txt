1) Input - Number, prime number
Log Fibonacci takes 0 millisecs even for inputs ~1 billion and more. whereas linear fibonacci takes
roughly 15 secs to compute f_n%p for input of size 1 billion.

sample console:

Enter the number:
2398239
Enter a prime number
999953

result:124619
time:44
result:124619
time:0

2) Input - randomized array with duplicate elements
Quick Sort using single pivot takes between 4-5 sec to sort array of input size 10 million,
whereas using two pivot it takes approx 5 secs to sort the same input which is almost equal but slightly 
greater than single pivot. For smaller inputs single pivot does better by a fair margin, but as the
input size increases, the running time of both alogrithms converges though never crosses.

sample console:

//Single Pivot
Enter size of array:
10000000

4289
//Dual Pivot
Enter the size of the array:
10000000

4489

3) Input - randomized array with duplicate elements
Quick Sort sorts the array slightly faster than Merge Sort.
For input size 10 million
Quick Sort takes between 4-5 secs
Merge Sort takes 5 secs.

sample console:

Enter size of array:
10000000

QuickSort: 4283
MergeSort: 5170
