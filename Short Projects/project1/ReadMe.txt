SetFunctions.java
1. To run the code:
	a) javac SetFunctions.java
	b) java SetFunctions
c) Enter the number of elements in the first list ,followed by the elements of the set.(eg. 3 -1 4 5)
d) Enter the number of elements in the second list ,followed by the elements of the set.(eg. 3 -1 4 5).
e) The intersection,difference and union will be printed

Sample console:

Enter the number of integers i
Enter the count for A:
2

4 5
Enter the count for B:
2
3 4
Union
3 4 5 
Intersection
4 
Difference

For executing the second question. Execute the following commands :

>> javac LargeIntegerArithmetic.java
>> java LargeIntegerArithmetic

The program expects 2 user inputs which ask for number of digits of the  large numbers 
on which the addition and subtraction is to be done. 

Note : It is assumed that the second number is less than the first number. 
Considering this fact enter the second number digits less than the first number.

3) 
For executing the 4th question. Execute the following commands :

>> javac SinglyLinkedList.java
>> java SinglyLinkedList

The program makes random inputs and prints the sorted output

For executing the 4th question. Execute the following commands :

>> javac mergeSortStacks.java
>> java mergeSortStacks

The program reads as input the size of the array to be sorted.
It prints astop 20 elements of the input as well output array.

SinglyLinkedList.java
1. To run the code:
a) javac SinglyLinkedList.java
b) java SinglyLinkedList  n   k
(here n is the size of the linked list and k is the argument to multiUnZip function)
c) You will see the original list, reversed list and the zipped list
