Problem 1) 
The folder Question_1 has the following files which are required to execute the program :
> LevelOrderTraversal.java
> Node.java

The input is given in the main method. 
The tree constructed in the program is :
                      12
	           10    15  
	          8  11 13 17
Output :
The level order traversal of the above tree will be :
12 10 15 8 11 13 17 

To execute the program, run the following commands :

>> cd Question_1
>> javac *.java
>> java LevelOrderTraversal

Problem 2)

The folder Question_2 has the following files which are required to execute the program :
> BSTFromSortedArray.java
> Node.java

The input : sorted array is given in the program : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

Output :

The tree constructed form this input is :
		4
           2         6
         1   3     5   7

The pre-order traversal of the tree is printed as output .
The preorder traversal of the given tree is : 4,2,1,3,6,5,7

To execute the program, run the following commands :

>> cd Question_2
>> javac *.java
>> java BSTFromSortedArray
