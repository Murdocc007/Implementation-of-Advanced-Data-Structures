Solution1 folder contains 3 java files :
1)	DAGTopologicalOrder.java
2)	Vertex.java
3)	Graph.java
 
The input is given in the program iteself. Both the algorithms return the topological ordering of the same graph.

To execute program follow the below commands :
>> javac DAGTopologicalOrder.java
>> java DAGTopologicalOrder

The program will give as an output topologically sorted array.
Two algorithms are implemented in the program - DAGTopologicalOrder.java
Vertex.java - is a class for Vertex 
Graph.java - is a class for Graph
