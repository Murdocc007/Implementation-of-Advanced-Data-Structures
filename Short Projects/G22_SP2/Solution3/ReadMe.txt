3) Strongly Connected Components

ConnectedComponents.java is the main class.
Graph.java is for representing a graph
Vertex.java is for representing a vertex of the graph
Edge.java is for representing an edge of the graph

I ran the following commands:

>javac ConnectedComponents.java
>java ConnectedComponents

Sample command line test case:

>javac ConnectedComponents.java
>java ConnectedComponents
Enter the size of graph:
4
Enter the no. of vertices:
4
Enter the no. of edges:
4
Enter the head vertex:
1
Enter the tail vertex
2
Enter the head vertex:
2
Enter the tail vertex
3
Enter the head vertex:
3
Enter the tail vertex
1
Enter the head vertex:
2
Enter the tail vertex
4
Vertex:1 Component:1
Vertex:2 Component:1
Vertex:3 Component:1
Vertex:4 Component:2
